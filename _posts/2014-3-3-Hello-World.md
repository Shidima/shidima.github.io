# It took about 5 minuts this time!
I'm trying out Jekyll this time. It's not so mutch a CMS, it's a static site generator. You edit your files in Markdown, commit to git (In my case I'm hosting it on github) and presto!

## And for the futere?
Well, thats a good question. I have been a bit flaky in writing, or shuld I say in any thing other then gaming. But I am trying to get away from there. I want to invest more time in doing things that will help me improve myself, while spending less money.
