# About me.
Hello, welcome to my little neck of the woods. My name is Christiaan, and I'm ~32 years old. I work as a SysAdmin / Devops for a Dutch web-dev and hsoting company. 

### Hobby's and Freetime

In my free time I work on my new House, to turn it into a home. What little time I have left after that I spend on my hobby's:
- Photography
- Playing games (Both on and of the PC)
- Messing with hard and software
- Trying my hand at writing games and software.

As you can see from my Git account, I have a few half finished projects there. Lately I'm trying to write games in C# and XNA, lets see how long I can keep that up :)
